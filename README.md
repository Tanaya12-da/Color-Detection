This repository showcases a color detection project, enabling you to analyze images and videos to identify and track specific colors. Built with Opencv, Numpy.
Key Features:

Accurate color detection: Identify specific colors using various methods (e.g., HSV, RGB).
Real-time processing: Analyze live video streams for color changes.
Customization: Define target colors and adjust detection parameters.
Visual output: Highlight detected colors or display color information.

I have used PIL library: Python Imaging Library is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
